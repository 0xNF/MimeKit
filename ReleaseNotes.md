# Release Notes

### MimeKit 1.0.3

* Improved MimeMessage.TextBody and MimeMessage.HtmlBody logic. (issue #87)
* Added new overrides of TextPart.GetText() and SetText() methods that take a
  charset string argument instead of a System.Text.Encoding.
* Fixed charset fallback logic to work properly (it incorrectly assumed that
  by default, Encoding.UTF8.GetString() would throw an exception when it
  encountered illegal byte sequences). (issue #88)
* Fixed S/MIME logic for finding X.509 certificates to use for encipherment.
  (issue #89)

### MimeKit 1.0.2

* Fixed MimeMessage.HtmlBody and MimeMessage.TextBody to properly
  handle nested multipart/alternatives (only generated by automated
  mailers).

### MimeKit 1.0.1

* Added MimeMessage.HtmlBody and MimeMessage.TextBody convenience properties.
* Added TextPart.IsPlain and TextPart.IsHtml convenience properties.
